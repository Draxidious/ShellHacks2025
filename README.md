## üé≤ Making careers fun for everyone
Have you ever been asked, "What would you like to be when you grow up?" This question can be daunting, and we all felt that we had a hard time answering this as kids. We wanted to bring an interesting twist to career education, to try and make it more interesting and engaging for everyone. cAReeropoly allows its players to learn more about potential careers paths while enjoying a game of Monopoly.

##üí° What it does
cAReeropoly is an augmented reality application which simulates a game of Monopoly, but with a unique twist. Throughout the game, there are trivia questions and facts about a chosen career path, which lets users learn a bit more about that path while also getting to enjoy a game of Monopoly with their friends. cAReeropoly is multi-player, bringing even more fun to the job exploration.

## üõ†Ô∏è How we built it
We developed this AR application with Unity, leveraging the software to bring functionality to 3D models. We also did some 3D modeling with Blender, and used the Meta SDK to interact with our Meta Quest headsets. 

## üß© Challenges we ran into
Networking between headsets was very difficult, given many constraints with the school Wi-Fi. We managed to get it working, but not without some workarounds, such as utilizing our personal hotspots. We also ran into difficulties with game functionality: there were many components to keep track of along with each of their functionality. Finally, we had issues with field-of-view, as the board was super huge for most of our development.

## üèÜ Accomplishments that we're proud of
2 out of 4 members of our group were new to Unity, and we're proud that everyone was able to get acclimated to the tool very quickly.  We're proud that we were able to get a good-looking, functional Monopoly board working in such a short time, as we ran into many struggles coming into the project. 

## üìö What we learned
* Divide work among team members efficiently
* Stay on task!!!
* REST!!!!!
* Communication is extremely valuable
* Ask for help as soon as you need it
* Networking with Unity is hard....

## üöÄ What's next for cAReeropoly
We have many goals going forward! Some goals include integrating AI, and allowing it to write more questions and provide more content on different professions. We also want to add the ability to play with a large group, and even the ability to play remotely.
